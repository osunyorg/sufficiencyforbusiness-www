  <p>Submit your contributions to track 2.4 by January 15th at <a href="https://www.conftool.org/nbm2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.conftool.org/nbm2026/ <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a></p><p>We welcome contributions that dive into the practicalities of making sufficiency a business reality: what tools and business models are actors using to embed it? How are experiments being scaled? Who are the leading pioneers, who are the adapting contenders, and who is lagging behind? What tensions arise around growth? What policies and consumption behaviours are needed to support the shift from the conventional material growth mindset to the sufficiency ethos?</p>
notes: >-
  <p>The track is hosted by Laura Niessen, Maike Gossen, Benjamin Combes and Lotte Levelt.</p>
